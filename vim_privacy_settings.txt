" doN'T make any backups when writing the buffer to file
set  nobackup
set  nowritebackup

" enabling the 'modeline' option allows us to annotate a file by setting
" variables that are specific to that file - but this can be a security
" risk for some people
set  nomodeline

" doN'T use tmp files when executing a shell cmd (like %!ls) inside Vim
set  noshelltemp

" store the buffer text in memory instead of a swapfile
set  noswapfile

" Vim saves the undo history in 'undodir' when it writes a buffer to file
" and restores the undo history from the same file when it's read into a
" buffer - turning this opt off tells Vim not use an undo file
" - note that turning this option off doesN'T delete any undo files
set  noundofile

" the viminfo file "~/.viminfo" makes it possible to continue our session
" from where we left off - the file is read when Vim starts and it's
" written when Vim quits - the viminfo setting takes a comma separated
" list of parameters that tell Vim what info to save - we can save a lot
" of information in the viminfo file, including command line history,
" search history, contents of nonempty registers, buffer list, and local
" and global marks - this settings tells Vim not to save anything
set  viminfo=

" doN'T automatically save modified files on buffer switch
set  noautowrite

" when a file has changed outside of Vim, doN'T automatically read it
" - instead prompt the user on what action to take
set  noautoread
